# PLUM - The Social Link



## Overview
PLUM is a fast way to connect to new people either in a work or social environment. Giving you the option to use a pin, QR code or NFC to share information about yourself very quickly.
PLUM will give the user the chance to add different pieces of information about themselves when they create an account, this will include information such as social networking site page links, personal/business website, number or email address. The information can be infinite.
Depending on the situation you are in can decide the amount of information you would like to send to the recipient, we allow multiple groups per user. E.G (Workplace, Interview, Nightclub). This allows you to use plum in every situation without feeling uneasy into who you are supplying your information.
